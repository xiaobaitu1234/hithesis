@article{fu2018,
   abstract = {The prohibitive cost of deploying a sophisticated DNS-based CDN makes anycast-based CDN an attractive alternative for new or small CDN operators. In anycast-based CDNs, user requests are naturally routed to the &#x201C;closest&#x201D; server determined by Internet routing. For the operators, however, this comes at a cost&#x2014;<i>loss of control</i>&#x2014;how the traffic is routed is entirely at the mercy of BGP routing. The &#x201C;closest&#x201D; server may be overloaded, or simply not the best choice. This &#x201C;loss of control&#x201D; undermines the <i>scalability</i> of anycast-based CDN architectures. To have control over how traffic is routed, existing work either requires adding a large amount of complexity to the system (high Capex/Opex) or is unable to achieve precise and fine-grained control. This paper proposes T-SAC, a scalable anycast-based CDN architecture that capitalizes on the programmability and flexibility of SDN/NFV, enabling fine-grained traffic redirection among CDN servers. T-SAC achieves precise control by leveraging a load-based redirection algorithm and a single 1-bit no-redirect flag. We implement T-SAC in the real system and evaluate its performance from various aspects using DASH and web applications. The results show that T-SAC is capable of redirecting the right amount of traffic at the right time to the right servers, making the system highly scalable.},

@article{liu2018,
   abstract = {With the development of network function virtualization and software-defined network standards, the mobile network operators are interested in integrating content delivery network (CDN) functionalities into the mobile network to enhance their capability for supporting content oriented services. We consider a mobile CDN system, where Base Stations (BSs) are equipped with storage for replicating content. In such a system, BSs cooperation in replying user requests through backhaul links is a widely adopted mechanism. Blindly redirect user requests upon content placement can cause traffic congestion. As a result, congestion avoidance and load balancing is an important issue to be tackled in this scenario. We investigated the joint optimization problem of content placement and request redirection for the BS-based mobile CDN. Specifically, each BS maintains a transmission queue for replying requests issued from other BSs. Network congestion and BSs load balancing can be jointly considered through guaranteeing network stability. We employ the stochastic optimization model to minimize the long-term time-average transmission cost under network stability constraints. By using the Lyapunov optimization technique, we transform the long-term problem into a set of linear programs solved in each short time duration, and we develop an on-line algorithm to efficiently decide content placement and request redirection without requiring a priori knowledge on the random network state information. Through our theoretical analysis, the performance of the algorithm on optimality and network stability is given. The evaluation confirms that our solution can achieve low transmission cost, whilst avoiding congestion and balancing traffic loads.},

   abstract = {It has become an increasingly popular trend to replicate network content across a geographically distributed structure. The Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a prime example. Content providers have been struggling to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of its clients via accurate predictions of CDN performance, which is a crucial prerequisite for subsequent policies like resource scheduling. Methods of Artificial Intelligence (AI) like machine learning and deep learning have shown their advantages on performance predictions recently, but it is still challenging to simultaneously ensure accuracy, generality and low overhead. In this paper, we propose a general AI-defined attention network to make predictions on CDN performance, the results of which can improve CDN resource optimal scheduling. First, we formulate this CDN performance prediction problem as a sequence learning problem. And then we design a two-phase deep neural network with attention so that our model can work well for all cache groups in a CDN. Experiment results show that our model outperforms state-of-art models in accuracy while maintaining a relatively low training overhead.},

   abstract = {A Content Delivery Network (CDN) employs edge-servers caching content close to end-users to provide high Quality of Service (QoS) in serving digital content. Attacks against edge-servers are known to cause QoS degradation and disruption in serving end-users. Protecting edge-servers is vital but represents a complex task. Not only must the attack mitigation be immediately effective, but the corresponding overhead should also not negatively affect the QoS of legitimate users. We propose a software-based security system for CDN edge-servers to mitigate various attacks. The approach is to automatically react to threats by deploying and managing security services. These security services are realized using virtualized security function chains created, configured, and removed dynamically. The desired system behavior is governed by high-level security policies dictated by a network operator. We demonstrate how our system can be programmed using these policies to automatically handle real-world attacks. Our performance evaluation shows that our system is low-overhead, immediately responds to threats, and quickly recovers legitimate traffic throughput.},
